# LPG-Gas-Leakage-Detector-with-Buzzer-Alert-and-Notification-System
Second year Project
The LPG Gas Leakage Detector with Buzzer Alert and Notification System is a safety device designed to detect gas leaks in homes or industries. It uses a gas sensor (like MQ-6) to sense LPG presence in the air. When a leak is detected, the system triggers a buzzer for immediate alert and sends a notification (via SMS or app) to the user. This helps prevent accidents by enabling quick response to gas leaks.
